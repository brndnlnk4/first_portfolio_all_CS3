							Hi folks, welcome to my portfolio. Are you looking for an expert web-designer, developer and web application programmer? 
							If not then maybe I can help you find what you are looking for or else you have come to the right place. I'm an American born artist originating out of the lone star state of Texas. I was raised in Dallas, yet had the chance to 
							visit and even live in various parts of the world during earlier years of my life. Prior to the millenium, my family
							and I took upon a world wide journey to Africa and Germany to visit extended relatives. Most of my entire family consists of a unique mix of ethnic diversity.
							My Mother was born in Germany and my Father in Nigeria, thus rendering me a 'mut'. Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this quick bio of I, your expert web developer.
